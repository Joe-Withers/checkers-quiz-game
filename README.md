# checkers-quiz-game
A checkers game which integrates a quiz into the game play to encourage fun learning.

My first programming project, completed as part of my A-level computing module.

The project is designed as a fun learning tool. It's core concept is a checkers game in which students can play against each other to compete for points for themselves and their school houses. For certain moves in the checkers game, such as taking an opponents peice or getting to the end, a timed multiple choice question needs to be answered correctly to gain extra points.

All users information (login, privaledge, etc) as well as their previous games and scores are stored in a fully relational microsoft access database.

# installation
Clone the repository, and open the project in Delphi. Compile and run from within the Delphi IDE.
_Note that some hard coded paths may need to be changed in the code_
